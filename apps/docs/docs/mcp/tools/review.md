# Weekly Review Tools

Tools for managing the weekly review process, a core GTD practice.

:::info Personal Reviews
Weekly reviews are **personal to each user**. Review pages, prompts, and reflections are private and visible only to the user who created them. This ensures honest self-reflection without concerns about visibility to teammates.
:::

## Available Tools

    "workspace_id": "ws_123",
    "space_id": "space_456"
  }
}
```

**Response:**

```json
{
  "page": {
    "id": "page_review_2024w03",

  }
}
```

    "workspace_id": "ws_123",
    "space_id": "space_456",
    "questions": [
      "What were your biggest wins this week?",
      "What tasks kept getting deferred and why?",
      "Are there any projects that need to be put on hold?"
    ],
    "source": "agent"
  }
}
```

    },
    {
      "id": "prompt_002",

      "source": "agent",
      "status": "pending",
      "weekNumber": 3,
      "createdAt": "2024-01-15T10:00:00Z"
    },
    {
      "id": "prompt_003",
      "question": "Are there any projects that need to be put on hold?",

      "weekNumber": 3,
      "createdAt": "2024-01-15T10:00:00Z"
    }
  ]
}
```

### review_list_pending

List pending review prompts for the current week that haven't been addressed yet.

```json
{
  "name": "review_list_pending",
  "arguments": {
    "workspace_id": "ws_123",
    "space_id": "space_456"
  }
}
```

**Response:**

```json
{
  "prompts": [
    {
      "id": "prompt_002",
      "question": "What tasks kept getting deferred and why?",
      "source": "agent",
      "status": "pending",
      "weekNumber": 3,
      "createdAt": "2024-01-15T10:00:00Z"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Review Sections

The weekly review page follows the GTD methodology with three main sections:

| Section | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| **Get Clear** | Process inbox, capture loose ends, empty your head |
| **Get Current** | Review projects, update task statuses, check calendar |
| **Get Creative** | Brainstorm new ideas, review someday/maybe list |

## Prompt Sources

| Source | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `agent` | Prompts generated by an AI agent based on activity |
| `system` | Standard GTD review prompts |
| `user` | Custom prompts created by the user |

## Example: Agent-Assisted Review

```typescript
// Ensure review page exists for this week
const page = await mcp.call("review_ensure_page", {
  workspace_id: "ws_123",
  space_id: "space_456"
});

// Analyze user's week and generate personalized prompts
const deferredTasks = await mcp.call("tasks_list", {
  workspace_id: "ws_123",
  status: "todo",
  updated_before: "2024-01-08"  // Tasks untouched for a week
});

const prompts = [];
if (deferredTasks.tasks.length > 5) {
  prompts.push("You have several tasks that haven't moved in a week. Are these still relevant?");
}

// Create the prompts
await mcp.call("review_create_prompts", {
  workspace_id: "ws_123",
  space_id: "space_456",
  questions: prompts,
  source: "agent"
});

// Later, check what's still pending
const pending = await mcp.call("review_list_pending", {
  workspace_id: "ws_123",
  space_id: "space_456"
});

console.log(`${pending.prompts.length} prompts still need reflection`);
```
